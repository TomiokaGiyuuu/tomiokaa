                        <h2>One Piece</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>Release: July 19, 1997</p>
                        <p>Country: Japan</p>

                        <p>Genre: Adventure, Action, Fantasy</p>
                        <p>The series focuses on Monke y D. Luffy, a young man inspired by his childhood idol and the powerful pirate Redhead Shanks, travels from the East Blue Sea to find the titular treasure and declare himself the king of pirates. While trying to organize his team, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy rescues and befriends a swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they set off in search of One Piece. On their journey they are joined by Nami, a navigator and a thief; Usopp, the sniper and the pathological liar; and Vinsmoke Sanji, the womanizer chef. They acquire a ship called the Going Merry and clash with the notorious East Blue pirates. As Luffy and his crew embark on their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, a doctor and an anthropomorphized reindeer; Nico Robin, archaeologist and former assassin; Frankie, the cyborg carpenter; Brook, skeleton musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, the fisherman helmsman and former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Once the Going Merry becomes out of order, the Straw Hat Pirates acquire a new ship called the Thousand Sunny. Together, they face other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents and soldiers of the corrupt World Government, and various other friends and enemies as they sail the seas in search of their dreams.</p>
