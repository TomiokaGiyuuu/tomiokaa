                        <p>The main character of the anime, Light Yagami, is the best high school student in Japan and the son of a police officer.  One day the god of death named Ryuk got bored, so he decided to throw one of his death notes into the human world.  On the way from school, Light finds a black notebook lying on the ground and decides to test its performance.  Arriving home, in accordance with the rules, he wrote in a notebook the name of the criminal who was shown on television at that time.  To Light's surprise, the culprit did indeed die of a heart attack forty seconds later.  After making sure that the death note is working, he decides to build a new world where only kind and responsible people will live, taking the life of all the criminals mentioned in the media.  After a while, Ryuk appears to Light.  He says that Light received the notebook by pure chance, since Ryuk sent it to the human world out of boredom, and now he hopes that Light will entertain him, but does not promise to help, for the most part remaining only an outside observer.
