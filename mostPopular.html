However, as they grew up, the stark difference between them became evident. While Yuno is able to wield magic with amazing power and control, Asta cannot use magic at all and desperately tries to awaken his powers by training physically.</p>

To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter.</p>
